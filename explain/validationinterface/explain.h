hey guys and welcome back to our next video!

today i will explain 2 files: validationinterface.h & validationinterface.cpp

well if you did follow this video series from its beginning, you should be familiar right now with how things are explained to you.
the purpose, raw containments of declarations and functions etc....
i still wanna inform you that it is essentially meant for understanding of how mighty this bitcoin thing really is and capable of!
realising us in sum the perfect monetary and fully digitized Banking System for todays times for the Internet. And in a decentralised way :)


					we reached the validation* files in this process dealing with Signaling issues for the wallets.

					i still decided not walking through the implemented logic itself, as most of the functions are self explanatory
					and it would just blow the time frames off for those videos produced. but i will make an exeption if necessary for it
					a guy into this is not interested in wasting his time either by	watching this stuff
					and its even better if he learns understanding code logic on implemented functions by himself.
					its a learning process after all and cannot be learned by just watching videos alone cause you need to type code
					you need to programm this yourself to really grasp used logic terms in full.
					this can only be done by coding your own small little programms from scratch (what i herby strongly recommend)
					and working with the standard c++ libraries (as well as the one that boost is offering).
					as well with your used IDE (compiler errors, runtime errors etc..) + general frustrating moments when stuck in code ;)
					But this video series should help a lot for getting a better overview of things and accessing the coders mind and work flow
					for oneself!!!


ok indroduction part done so lets not waste more of our precious time here and instead jump start right into this!!!
