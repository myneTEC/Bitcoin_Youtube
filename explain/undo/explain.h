hey guys and welcome back to our next video!

today i will explain 1 file: undo.h

well if you did follow this video series from its beginning, you should be familiar right now with how things are explained to you.
the purpose, raw containments of declarations and functions etc....
i still wanna inform you that it is essentially meant for understanding of how mighty this bitcoin thing really is and capable of!
realising us in sum the perfect monetary and fully digitized Banking System for todays times for the Internet. And in a decentralised way :)


					we reached the undo file in this process dealing with undoing functionality for Coin Transactions.

					most of the functions are self explanatory

					i will herby discard on my before used textblock at this given point and create a new one:

					the problem that comes here with going to deep into for the logic will just blow this video in size. and from my own experience
					people prefer watching smaller over longer videos as well.
					But i strongly recommend using this video for inspiration and motivation for creating your very own thing with this Technology
					start getting more into code and download your very first IDE like Eclipse i am using here if you are completely new to all this
					you will soon get better in understanding the relationships for coding and becoming a better problem solver as well.
					i Just decided to give a bit of help for how to get a fast overview of this vast majority of code files bitcoin consists of
					to make it easier for simple minded guys getting into this complex world of blockchain technology.


ok indroduction part done so lets not waste more of our precious time here and instead jump start right into this!!!
